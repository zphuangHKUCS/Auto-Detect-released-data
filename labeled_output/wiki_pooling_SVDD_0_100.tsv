In the end, the group succeeded and P.J. was arrested for his actions and for taking promcin; although his ability was shown to have helped bring Jordan Collier and Tom Baldwin a step closer to being friends.___(Deceased) Works in the Theory Room department at NTAC with Marco Pacella and P.J.

After his efforts to help infants were made public, he was identified as a wanted man for war crimes in Rwanda but was allowed to stay on the condition he kept healing. When it was discovered his gift was killing him (caused his own chromosomes to mutate and slowly destroy his body with developing heart disease and spinal irregularities), and faced with execution if he stopped healing, Edwin decided to keep using his ability for as long as his body allowed as penance for his crimes. Edwin died less than a year later.___(Deceased) One of the original 4400, she disappeared February 2, 1998.
